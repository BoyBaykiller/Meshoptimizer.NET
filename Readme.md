C# bindings the popular C++ library, üêá [meshoptimizer](https://github.com/zeux/meshoptimizer/tree/e47e1be6d3d9513153188216455bdbed40a206ef), designed for optimizing 3D models and meshes. This port uses Platform Invocation Services (PInvoke) to interact with the original C++ library, allowing developers to utilize the powerful optimization features of meshoptimizer within C# and .NET applications.
